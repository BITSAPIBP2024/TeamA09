# Project Summary: Blockchain Approach to Gold Provenance and Verification

## Project Overview:
The project focuses on using blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity, ethical sourcing, and traceability of gold. Traditional verification methods often lack transparency and are vulnerable to fraud, while blockchain offers a decentralized, immutable, and transparent system that addresses these issues effectively. This project aims to provide a robust solution to track the provenance and verification of gold.

## Team Members:
- Antony Ashwin (2023sl93002)
- Abhishek Bantiya (2023sl93003)
- Abani Kaur Kohli (2023sl93056)
- Suyash Tripathi (2023sl93048)

---

## Key Features:
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses blockchain to ensure transparency and prevent fraud in the gold supply chain.
- **Decentralized System**: Ensures a tamper-proof and immutable ledger.
- **Gold Provenance**: Tracks the journey of gold from mining to its final destination, ensuring ethical sourcing.

---

## What is Good:
- **Innovative Solution**: The use of blockchain for gold provenance is an innovative and relevant application in todayâ€™s market, especially for ensuring ethical sourcing and authenticity.
- **Transparency**: Blockchain provides a transparent and secure way to track the origin of gold, which is crucial for consumers and businesses.
- **Comprehensive Setup**: The setup process is well-documented, making it easy for others to run and test the project locally.

---

## What Can Be Better:
- **Scalability**: The project could be improved by ensuring that the blockchain system can scale effectively to handle larger volumes of transactions, especially for global gold trade.
- **User Interface**: The project currently lacks a focus on user interface design; adding a front-end dashboard for visualizing the gold provenance data would enhance user experience.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: The project could be improved by integrating it with existing gold trading platforms or industry standards for easier adoption.

---

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the powerful potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing gold provenance and verification. While the foundation is strong, there are opportunities to improve scalability and user interface to increase its practical application and adoption.

# Product Management Tool - Project Overview

The project involves building a microservices-based architecture to manage products and offers. It includes several services designed for scalability, maintainability, and enhanced user experience:

- **microservice-ui** (frontend)
- **service-registry**
- **api-gateway**
- **product-service**
- **offer-service**

## Team Members:
- Bishal Pudel: 2023SL93025
- Harsh Tomar: 2023SL93050

## Microservices
- **product-service**: Handles product-related functionality.
- **offer-service**: Manages offers related to products.
- **service-registry**: Handles service discovery using Eureka.
- **api-gateway**: Manages API routing and load balancing.

## Business Use Case Documentation
- [Business Use Case](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zE-AAtCcXp3k_mMkBKh0Fd4YzmUGAbjdt49Tb9AAs3U/edit?usp=sharing)

## Swagger API Documentation
- [Product Microservice API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/watchserviceapi/watch-business/1.0.0#/ForecastTemperature)
- [Offer Microservice API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/2023SL93025/offerservice/1.0.0#/Offer/get_offer)

## What is Microservice?
Microservices is an architecture that allows services to be:
1. **Independently deployable**
2. **Independently scalable**

Each service can operate on different databases and be deployed and scaled independently. This project uses **product-service** and **offer-service** as microservices.

### Microservices Workflow
